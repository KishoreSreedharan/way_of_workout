          "  To begin, first set the bar on the height that best matches your height. Once the correct height is chosen and the bar is loaded, step under the bar and place the back of your shoulders across it.Hold on to the bar using both arms at each side, unlock it and lift it off the rack by first pushing with your legs and at the same time straightening your torso.Position your legs using a shoulder width medium stance with the toes slightly pointed out. Keep your head up at all times and also maintain a straight back. This will be your starting position.Begin to slowly lower the bar by bending the knees as you maintain a straight posture with the head up. Continue down until the angle between the upper leg and the calves becomes slightly less than 90-degrees. Inhale as you perform this portion of the movement. Tip: If you performed the exercise correctly, the front of the knees should make an imaginary straight line with the toes that is perpendicular to the front. If your knees are past that imaginary line then you are placing undue stress on the knee and the exercise has been performed incorrectly.Begin to raise the bar as you exhale by pushing the floor with the heel of your foot as you straighten the legs again and go back to the starting position.",

Bend your elbows so the goblet is positioned right at the center of your chest.Warm-up by using a lighter (or no) kettle-bell to get a sense of the movement. Then, progress to a heavier weight for your full set.Engage your core and look straight ahead—you want to keep your back neutrally aligned and your eyes facing straight ahead throughout the squat.Press your hips back and begin bending your knees to perform the squat. Inhale as you perform this downward phase.Keep the kettle-bell close to your body during the movement.Focus on keeping your chest tall as you continue pressing your hips back and lowering down. The goal is to get your hips below parallel with your knees.Make sure your weight remains evenly distributed across your feet, or slightly more weighted toward your heels—you shouldn't come up on your toes as you squat.",

Be sure to put your feet at about hip-width apart.Next, it’s time to step back and really get into the lunge. Start by taking a step back with your left leg. This will pace the majority of the load on your right leg. When doing this, be sure that you’re stepping back enough that your left knee is behind your right heel when it touches the ground Sink down until your back knee touches the ground and your front knee is at a 90-degree angle. It’s now time to drive upwards. Stand back up, making sure to really drive the weight with your front leg's heel and the ball of your foot. Try to keep your torso upright during this movement, though a slight lean forward is alright.As you are standing up all the way with your leading leg, bring your back leg back up to its starting position. During this part of the exercise, do your best to not lean and keep a proper balance.Once you’re back in the starting position, wait for a second and then repeat these steps with the other leg. Do this for as many reps as are needed for your routine.",
